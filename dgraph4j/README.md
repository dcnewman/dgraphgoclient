# Dgraph Client for Java

This is a very basic implementation for a Dgraph client in Java using Grpc.

To test the client code, you need a running instance of Dgraph in the following location:
* host: `localhost`
* port: `8081`

To run the tests simply execute:
```shell
$ ./gradlew test
```

## Distribution

Currently, given that this is the first version, the distribution is done via a fatJar
built locally. The procedure to build it is:

```shell
$ ./gradlew fatJar
```

This will generate the client library (and it's dependencies) in a single jar at:
```shell
$ ls dgraph4j/build/libs
dgraph4j-all-0.0.1.jar
```

**NOTE**: there's no discussion yet on how to (or if) distribute this package in any of the JAR
  repositories publicly available, e.g. Maven Central.

## How to use it?

You just need to include the fatJar into the classpath, the following is a simple
example of how to use it:

* Write `DgraphMain.java` (assuming Dgraph contains the data required for the query):
```java
import io.dgraph.client.DgraphClient;
import io.dgraph.client.GrpcDgraphClient;
import io.dgraph.client.DgraphResult;

public class DgraphMain {

    public static void main(final String[] args) {
        final DgraphClient dgraphClient = GrpcDgraphClient.newInstance("localhost", 8081);
        final DgraphResult result = dgraphClient.query("{me(_xid_: alice) { name _xid_ follows { name _xid_ follows {name _xid_ } } }}");
        System.out.println(result.toJsonObject().toString());
    }
}
```

* Compile:
```shell
$ javac -cp dgraph4j-all-0.0.1.jar DgraphMain.java
```

* Run:
```shell
$ java -cp dgraph4j-all-0.0.1.jar:. DgraphMain

```

## Word of caution

API for this client is likely to change constantly given current development in Dgraph.
